Sure, let's break down the flow and tasks for both the Spring Boot backend and the ReactJS frontend:

Spring Boot Backend:
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database with tables TblUserMaster, TblEmployeeMaster, and TblEmployeeDetail as described.
Use Hibernate to map these tables to Java entities.
Security Configuration:

Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Configure authentication providers, user details service, password encoding, etc.
RESTful APIs:

Create RESTful APIs for user authentication (login, forgot password, reset password).
Create APIs for CRUD operations on TblEmployeeMaster and TblEmployeeDetail.
Implement request validation and error handling.
Service Layer:

Implement services to handle business logic for user authentication and CRUD operations on employee records.
Controller Layer:

Create controllers to handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to the appropriate service methods.
Implement endpoint mappings for login, forgot password, reset password, and CRUD operations.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):

Define DTOs to transfer data between the frontend and backend.
Use DTOs to encapsulate request and response payloads for API endpoints.
ReactJS Frontend:
Project Setup:

Create a new ReactJS project using Create React App or a similar tool.
Component Structure:

Design and create React components for each functionality mentioned in the requirements (login, forgot password, reset password, home page, add record, update record, delete record).
Routing:

Set up routing using React Router to navigate between different pages or components.
Form Handling:

Implement forms using controlled components in React.
Use libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for form handling and validation.
HTTP Requests:

Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the backend APIs.
Handle responses from the backend and update the UI accordingly.
State Management:

Manage application state using React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks.
Use Redux or Context API for more complex state management if needed.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication flows such as login, forgot password, and reset password.
Manage user sessions and authentication tokens securely.
UI/UX Design:

Design user interfaces that are intuitive and responsive.
Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling if needed.
Testing:

Write unit tests for React components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
Perform integration testing to ensure that the frontend interacts correctly with the backend APIs.
Deployment:

Deploy the frontend application to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
Ensure that the deployed frontend can communicate with the backend APIs.
By following these steps, you can build a full-stack web application using Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend, providing the required functionalities for record maintenance.
